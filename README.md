# OpenPhysics `Baton`

Orchestration repository for the [OpenPhysics](https://github.com/OpenPhysics) organization. Baton owns
the **operational** side of the org: the reusable CI/CD workflows every simulation calls, the cross-repo
automation scripts, the Dependabot templates, the machine-readable repository catalog, and the GitHub
Pages simulation landing page.

> Community-health defaults (license, contributing, code of conduct, security policy, issue/PR templates,
> org profile) live in [OpenPhysics/.github](https://github.com/OpenPhysics/.github) — GitHub requires those
> in the special `.github` repo so they are inherited org-wide.

## Claude Code plugin

This repo doubles as a Claude Code [marketplace](.claude-plugin/marketplace.json). It publishes one
plugin, **`scenerystack`**, that bundles the [`skills/`](skills/) reference docs so any sim repo can
load them as a unit instead of vendoring copies. The repo root *is* the plugin
([`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`](.claude-plugin/plugin.json)); its `skills/` are auto-discovered.

Member repos enable it from their `.claude/settings.json` (the canonical keys live in
[`config/claude-settings.json`](config/claude-settings.json)):

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "openphysics": { "source": { "source": "github", "repo": "OpenPhysics/Baton" } }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": { "scenerystack@openphysics": true }
}
```

Or interactively: `claude plugin marketplace add OpenPhysics/Baton` then
`claude plugin install scenerystack@openphysics`. Validate manifest changes with
`claude plugin validate .claude-plugin/marketplace.json`.

Roll it out across the fleet with [`scripts/sync-claude-settings.sh`](scripts/sync-claude-settings.sh),
which merges those keys into every SceneryStack repo's settings without clobbering existing config.

## Shared CI

Each simulation's `.github/workflows/ci.yml` calls the reusable workflows from this repo:

```yaml
jobs:
  ci:
    uses: OpenPhysics/Baton/.github/workflows/ci.yml@main
  dependency-review:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    uses: OpenPhysics/Baton/.github/workflows/shared-dependency-review.yml@main
  codeql:
    uses: OpenPhysics/Baton/.github/workflows/shared-codeql.yml@main
```

Optional compliance checking:

```yaml
  compliance:
    uses: OpenPhysics/Baton/.github/workflows/shared-compliance-check.yml@main
    with:
      repo-name: ${{ github.event.repository.name }}
```

`ci.yml` runs the test step automatically when the caller defines a `test` npm script — no per-repo
flag needed. Pass `run-tests: "true"` to force it on (e.g. before a test script exists) or
`run-tests: "false"` to opt out.

Pages deploy (sims that publish to GitHub Pages):

```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    uses: OpenPhysics/Baton/.github/workflows/deploy.yml@main
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
```

## Compliance workflow

[`shared-compliance-check.yml`](.github/workflows/shared-compliance-check.yml) runs weekly (Mondays 06:00 UTC)
and on manual dispatch. It reads [`structure/repos.json`](structure/repos.json), clones each simulation repo,
and checks:

- **FAIL** if `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `LICENSE` exists at repo root (use the org defaults from `OpenPhysics/.github`)
- **FAIL** if `README.md` is missing `## Features`, `## Quick Start`, `## Scripts`, `## Tech Stack`, `## License`, or `## Contributing`
- **FAIL** if `README.md` sections are out of order or include extra top-level sections (only the six standard sections allowed)
- **FAIL** if `.github/workflows/ci.yml` does not call this repo's shared reusable CI workflow

Simulation READMEs use a fixed six-section outline (in order): **Features → Quick Start → Scripts → Tech Stack → License → Contributing**.

Run locally against a checkout:

```bash
scripts/check-repo-compliance.sh /path/to/sim-repo
```

## Repository catalog

[`structure/repos.json`](structure/repos.json) lists all OpenPhysics repositories with metadata (simulation
type, framework, deployed URL, physics topics, etc.). The compliance workflow, Pages landing page, and the
catalog scripts consume this file. See [`scripts/README.md`](scripts/README.md) for the tooling:

```bash
scripts/parse-repos.sh names --simulation
scripts/list-repos.sh --json
scripts/sync-github-metadata.sh --dry-run
```

Scripts assume the `Baton` repo lives beside member repos in a shared workspace; set
`OPENPHYSICS_WORKSPACE` or pass `--catalog /path/to/repos.json` if your checkout differs.

## Fleet operations

Cross-repo automation, all driven from the catalog:

- **Batch changes** — [`scripts/fleet-exec.sh`](scripts/fleet-exec.sh) clones each selected
  repo, runs a command, and (with `--apply`) opens one PR per repo. Dry-run by default. The
  [`fleet-exec.yml`](.github/workflows/fleet-exec.yml) workflow exposes it as a manual dispatch
  (e.g. bump a shared dependency, run `npm run fix`, apply a codemod). Opening PRs in other
  repos needs a `FLEET_PAT` secret with write access — the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` is scoped to
  Baton only. Setup steps (fine-grained PAT or GitHub App): [`doc/fleet-auth.md`](doc/fleet-auth.md).
- **Health report** — [`fleet-health.yml`](.github/workflows/fleet-health.yml) runs weekly,
  fanning out one matrix job per active simulation (npm download cache reused across runs) to run
  lint, type-check, build, and test, then publishing a pass/fail table to the job summary.
  Read-only; surfaces sims broken by a shared-workflow or dependency change.
- **Compliance audit** — [`shared-compliance-check.yml`](.github/workflows/shared-compliance-check.yml)
  audits README structure and CI wiring across the org. The dispatch/schedule run fans out one
  matrix job per sim and aggregates a single pass/fail table (see above).

## Node version

The default Node version for the fleet is **`"24"`**, declared in three places that must stay in
sync — bump them together:

- [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) — `node-version` input default
- [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml) — `node-version` input default
- [`.github/workflows/fleet-health.yml`](.github/workflows/fleet-health.yml) — `setup-node` step

[`scripts/check-node-version.sh`](scripts/check-node-version.sh) enforces that the three stay in
sync (run in CI by [`baton-selfcheck.yml`](.github/workflows/baton-selfcheck.yml)), so a half-done
bump fails fast instead of drifting silently.

When bumping, also update `@types/node` across member repos (Dependabot ignores its major bumps so
the runtime and types stay aligned — see the note in the Dependabot templates under `config/`).
