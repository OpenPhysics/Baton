description: Use when creating nodes, listeners, or Properties that do not live for the whole sim — dynamic objects, anything added and removed at runtime, or anything that links to a Property it does not own. Covers dispose(), the disposeEmitter, unlinking listeners, tearing down DerivedProperty/Multilink, and avoiding the memory leaks that fuzz testing catches.

# SceneryStack Disposal & Memory

The #1 source of sim bugs is **leaked listeners**: an object subscribes to a Property that outlives it, so it is never garbage-collected and keeps reacting after it should be gone. Anything created dynamically (per particle, per wave, per game round) must clean up everything it created in `dispose()`. Objects that live for the whole sim (the model, the single ScreenView) generally never dispose.

## The rule of ownership

> If you `link`/`addListener`/`addInputListener` to something you **did not create**, you must undo it in `dispose()`. If you created the Property/Emitter yourself, disposing *it* is enough.

A `link` from a long-lived Property to a short-lived node is a leak waiting to happen — the Property holds the node alive.

## The `dispose` pattern

PhET style: capture all teardown in one `dispose…` closure built in the constructor, then call it from `dispose()` before `super.dispose()`.

```typescript
import { Node } from "scenerystack/scenery";

export class ParticleNode extends Node {
  private readonly disposeParticleNode: () => void;

  public constructor(particle: Particle, modelViewTransform: ModelViewTransform2) {
    super();

    // links to a Property this node does NOT own → must be undone
    const positionListener = (p: Vector2) => { this.translation = modelViewTransform.modelToViewPosition(p); };
    particle.positionProperty.link(positionListener);

    const colorMultilink = Multilink.multilink(
      [particle.chargeProperty, ParticleColors.positiveColorProperty],
      (charge, color) => { this.fill = charge > 0 ? color : ParticleColors.negativeColorProperty.value; },
    );

    this.disposeParticleNode = () => {
      particle.positionProperty.unlink(positionListener);
      colorMultilink.dispose();
    };
  }

  public override dispose(): void {
    this.disposeParticleNode();
    super.dispose();
  }
}
```

## DerivedProperty, Multilink, Emitter

`DerivedProperty` and `Multilink` subscribe to their dependencies, so they leak if their dependencies outlive them. Dispose them (or build them with owned dependencies):

```typescript
const speedProperty = new DerivedProperty([particle.velocityProperty], (v) => v.magnitude);
// ...later, when the owner goes away:
speedProperty.dispose();   // unlinks from velocityProperty for you
```

For a node tied 1:1 to a model element, link cleanup to the model element's own removal Emitter instead of writing manual bookkeeping.

## Dynamic collections

When the view mirrors a model `createObservableArray()`, add a node on `addItemAddedListener` and **dispose it** on `addItemRemovedListener`:

```typescript
model.particles.addItemAddedListener((particle) => {
  const node = new ParticleNode(particle, modelViewTransform);
  this.particleLayer.addChild(node);
  const removed = (removedParticle: Particle) => {
    if (removedParticle === particle) {
      this.particleLayer.removeChild(node);
      node.dispose();                                   // <-- the easy line to forget
      model.particles.removeItemRemovedListener(removed);
    }
  };
  model.particles.addItemRemovedListener(removed);
});
```

## Rules

- A node that is created and removed at runtime **must** override `dispose()` and undo every external `link`/`addInputListener` it made.
- Disposing a `DerivedProperty`/`Multilink`/`Emitter` you created unlinks it from its dependencies — prefer that to manual unlink bookkeeping.
- Remove a child from the scene graph **and** call `child.dispose()`; `removeChild` alone does not dispose.
- Long-lived singletons (model, root ScreenView) don't need disposal — but anything they spawn per-object does.
- Mark a class that must never be disposed with `isDisposable: false` so an accidental `dispose()` throws instead of silently half-tearing-down.
- Listeners on a node's **own** child are fine to leave — they die with the node. The danger is linking to something *external* and longer-lived.

## Common mistakes

- `someExternalProperty.link(listener)` in a dynamic node with no matching `unlink` in `dispose()` → classic leak; the node is retained forever.
- `removeChild(node)` without `node.dispose()` → the node's own listeners still fire.
- A `DerivedProperty` built on model Properties, created per dynamic object, never disposed.
- Adding an item-removed listener but never removing **it**, so the closure (and node) leak even after the item is gone.
- Relying on Reset All to "clean up" — reset restores values, it does not dispose nodes.
