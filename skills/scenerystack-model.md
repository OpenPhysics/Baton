# SceneryStack Model

The **model** holds the simulation's state and physics in pure model units (SI). It must not know the view exists. Views observe the model through reactive `Property`s and the per-frame `step(dt)`; the model never reaches into Scenery nodes.

## The `TModel` contract

A screen's top-level model implements `TModel` from `scenerystack/joist`, which requires `step(dt)` and `reset()`:

```typescript
import type { TModel } from "scenerystack/joist";
import { BooleanProperty, NumberProperty } from "scenerystack/axon";
import { Range, Vector2, Vector2Property } from "scenerystack/dot";

export class SimModel implements TModel {
  public readonly positionProperty: Vector2Property;
  public readonly speedProperty: NumberProperty;
  public readonly isRunningProperty: BooleanProperty;

  public constructor() {
    this.positionProperty = new Vector2Property(new Vector2(0, 0));
    this.speedProperty = new NumberProperty(0, { range: new Range(0, 343) });
    this.isRunningProperty = new BooleanProperty(true);
  }

  // advance the physics by dt seconds (real, unscaled time)
  public step(dt: number): void {
    if (!this.isRunningProperty.value) return;
    const p = this.positionProperty.value;
    this.positionProperty.value = p.plusXY(this.speedProperty.value * dt, 0);
  }

  // restore every Property to its initial value
  public reset(): void {
    this.positionProperty.reset();
    this.speedProperty.reset();
    this.isRunningProperty.reset();
  }
}
```

## State lives in Properties

Model state is a set of `Property`s (`NumberProperty`, `BooleanProperty`, `Vector2Property`, `EnumerationProperty`, `Property<T>`), with **derived** quantities as `DerivedProperty` so they recompute automatically:

```typescript
import { DerivedProperty } from "scenerystack/axon";

this.frequencyProperty = new DerivedProperty(
  [this.springConstantProperty, this.massProperty],
  (k, m) => Math.sqrt(k / m) / (2 * Math.PI),
);
```

Expose read-only state to the view as `TReadOnlyProperty<T>` so the view can observe but not assign it. Use `createObservableArray()` for collections of model objects (waves, particles) that the view mirrors.

## The frame loop

`step(dt)` is called every animation frame with elapsed **seconds**. Keep physics here, integrate with `dt`, and gate on `isRunningProperty`. Some sims run a fixed-timestep loop (`model.step(FIXED_DT)`) inside the screen's step for numerical stability — follow the sim's existing pattern.

## Rules

- **Model never imports from `view/`.** The dependency points one way: view → model. If a model file imports a Node, that logic belongs in the view.
- Every piece of mutable state is a `Property`; reset each one in `reset()`. A field you forget to reset is a Reset-All bug.
- Compute, don't cache: prefer `DerivedProperty` over manually updating a plain field in `step`.
- Keep physical constants in a `*Constants.ts` module in SI units (see scenerystack-constants); the model imports them.
- `step(dt)` works in real seconds; apply any "time speed" / slow-motion scaling explicitly, don't bake it into constants.

## Common mistakes

- A model class with `import { ... } from ".../view/..."` → inverts the architecture; move the code to the view.
- New `Property` added but not reset in `reset()` → Reset All leaves stale state.
- Doing layout math (pixels, `ModelViewTransform2`) in the model → coordinates are the view's job; the model is unit-only.
- Mutating a `DerivedProperty` by hand → it's computed; change its dependencies instead.
